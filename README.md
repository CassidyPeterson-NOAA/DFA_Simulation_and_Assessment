# DFA_Simulation_and_Assessment
Code associated with DFA Simulation and DFA in Stock Assessment projects

## DFA Simulation 

This is a repository to host code designed to conduct a simulation study on (1) whether dynamic factor analysis (DFA) can be used to reconcile conflicting survey indices of abundance, and (2) whether that DFA trend can be used as an input into a stock assessment model instead of multiple, 'raw' conflicting survey indices. The example species for this simulation were the sandbar shark and Atlantic sharpnose shark. 

Scripts contain functions to conduct the species-specific DFA simulation detailed in Peterson et al. (2021) for both sandbar and Atlantic shparnose sharks, and a script detailing how the low-fecundity stock recruitment parameters were defined following Taylor et al. (2013).
